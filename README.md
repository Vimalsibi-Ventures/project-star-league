# ⭐ Project Star League

Project Star League is a **squadron-based competitive scoring system** designed for Toastmasters clubs. It transforms regular meetings into a structured, fair, and transparent league where **teams (Squadrons) compete using Stars (★)** earned through participation, discipline, and teamwork.

This document is the **authoritative explanation** of how Star League works for members. If a rule, reward, or penalty is not written here, it does not exist.

---

## 1️⃣ What Star League Is (And Is Not)

### Star League is NOT:

* An individual XP or points system
* A per-role farming system
* A quantity-over-quality reward model

### Star League IS:

* A **Squadron-owned economy**
* **Evaluated per meeting**, not per role
* Designed to reward:

  * Fair role rotation
  * Consistent attendance
  * Team presence
  * Disciplined participation

> **Individuals perform. Squadrons earn. Seasons remember.**

---

## 2️⃣ Ownership of Stars (Critical Rule)

* ⭐ **Only Squadrons own stars**
* Individuals never have a personal star balance
* Every star earned by a member is credited directly to their Squadron

### Individuals are tracked only for:

* Awards
* Hall of Fame recognition
* Historical performance records

Leaderboards always rank **Squadrons**, never individuals.

---

## 3️⃣ When Stars Are Calculated

Stars are evaluated **once per meeting per squadron**.

They are **NOT** calculated:

* Per role
* Per speech
* Per task

Even if a squadron performs multiple roles or dominates a meeting, bonuses are applied only where explicitly defined.

This prevents:

* Role hoarding
* Score inflation
* System exploitation

---

## 4️⃣ Role-Based Star Earnings

When a member performs a role successfully, stars are added to the **Squadron Star Pool**.

### 🎤 Speaking Role

* **Speaker** → **+10★**

Speaker cooldown applies:

* After speaking, a member enters a **2-meeting cooldown**
* Speaking during cooldown:

  * Still earns +10★
  * **Breaks rotation**
  * Removes rotation bonus for that meeting

---

### 📝 Evaluation Role

* **Evaluator** → **+5★**

---

### 🎯 Functionary Roles

Each of the following earns **+5★**:

* Toastmaster of the Day (TMOD)
* Table Topics Master (TTM)
* General Evaluator (GE)
* Any other approved functionary role

Notes:

* GE **does earn stars**
* GE **cannot win Best Performer awards**

---

## 5️⃣ Attendance-Based Stars

### 👥 Individual Attendance

* Each squadron member attending → **+5★**
* Guests:

  * May participate
  * Generate **0★**

### 🟢 Perfect Attendance Bonus

* If **all members of a squadron attend**:

  * **+20★**
  * Applied once per meeting

---

## 6️⃣ Rotation & Discipline Bonuses

### 🔁 Speaker Rotation Bonus

* If the **correct next member** in the squadron’s speaking order speaks:

  * **+5★** (once per meeting)

Breaking rotation:

* No rotation bonus
* Rotation streak resets to zero

---

## 7️⃣ Table Topics & Activity Star System

Table Topics, games, and activity sessions are treated as **Activity Sessions**.

### 🧑 Individual Participation (Per Squadron)

Order matters **within the same squadron**:

* First participating member → **+15★**
* Each additional participating member → **+10★**

Guests:

* Can participate
* Earn **0★**

---

### 🤝 Activity Synergy Bonus

If **N members from the same squadron** participate in the activity:

* **+5★ × N**

This bonus is **in addition to** individual activity stars.

---

## 8️⃣ Awards (Recognition Layer)

Awards are **recognition tools**, not farming tools.

### 🏅 Available Awards

* Best Speaker
* Best Evaluator
* Best Table Topics Speaker
* Best Role Player

Rules:

* Candidates must be finalized participants
* Each award gives **+5★** to the winner’s squadron
* GE is excluded from Best Performer awards

---

## 9️⃣ Squadron Synergy Bonus (Meeting-Level)

If a squadron has **multiple active members** in a meeting:

* Additional **synergy stars** are awarded
* Calculated **once per meeting**

This encourages:

* Team presence
* Distributed effort
* Active participation beyond a single member

---

## 🔟 Penalties (Star Deductions)

Penalties are applied at **meeting closure** and are permanent.

* Late arrival → **−5★**
* Speaker no-show → **−20★**

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Seasons & Hall of Fame

### 🏁 Seasons

* Star League runs in seasons
* Seasons are closed by admins
* New seasons reseed squadrons

### 🏆 Hall of Fame

Preserves:

* Winning Squadrons
* Top-performing individuals
* Season champions

Hall of Fame data:

* Persists across resets
* Is viewable by all members

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Leaderboards & Rankings

* Leaderboards are **squadron-based only**
* Equal stars = shared rank
* No artificial tie-breakers

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ What Members Can Do on the Site

Members can:

* View the squadron leaderboard
* See season number and standings
* Explore Hall of Fame records
* Review past meetings
* Understand how and why stars were earned

## 📌 Final Principle

Play fair.
Rotate roles.
Show up as a squadron.

That is how championships are built.
